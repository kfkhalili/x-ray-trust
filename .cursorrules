# X-Ray Trust - Cursor Rules

## Code Philosophy

### Comments: Why, Not What
- Comments explain **WHY** decisions were made, not **WHAT** the code does
- If code needs explanation of what it does, the code should be clearer
- Focus on reasoning, trade-offs, and design decisions
- Example: "Why async? Next.js 16 made cookies() async..." not "This function is async"

### Type Safety
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any`, no `unknown`, no type assertions
- Use `readonly` modifiers for immutability
- Prefer type inference where possible, explicit types where needed
- Domain types live in `types/trust.ts`

### Functional Programming
- Pure functions for trust calculations (no side effects)
- Immutable data transformations
- Prefer `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` over loops
- Trust engine is stateless and testable

## Next.js 16 Patterns

### Server Components & API Routes
- `cookies()` is now async - always `await` it
- Server-side Supabase client must be async: `await createClient()`
- API routes need `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent build-time analysis
- Use `@supabase/ssr` for cookie-based auth

### Client Components
- Mark with `"use client"` directive
- Use `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client` for browser-side operations
- SessionStorage + URL params for state persistence (see `app/page.tsx`)

## Supabase Patterns

### Client Selection
- **Server-side**: `@/lib/supabase/server` - async, handles cookies automatically
- **Client-side**: `@/lib/supabase/client` - browser, cookie-based auth
- **Admin/Webhooks**: `@/lib/supabase/admin` - bypasses RLS, service role key only

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Always use RLS for user-facing queries
- Admin client ONLY for webhooks and server-to-server operations
- Never expose service role key to client

## Stripe Integration

### Checkout Flow
- Store `userId` and `credits` in checkout session metadata
- Webhook handler extracts metadata to grant credits
- Always verify webhook signatures before processing

### Credit Packs
- Configure in `lib/stripe.ts` using `Map<string, number>` (Price ID → Credits)
- Empty by default - must be populated with actual Stripe Price IDs

## Trust Engine

### Scoring Algorithm
- 5 signals: Age (25%), Ratio (25%), Activity (25%), Engagement (15%), Listed (10%)
- Automated accounts get score cap of 15 (DANGER verdict)
- Missing data defaults to neutral (50) with reduced confidence
- All scoring functions are pure and testable

### Data Flow
- `XRawData` from twitterapi.io → `calculateTrust()` → `TrustReport`
- User info passed via `_userInfo` internal field
- Breakdown, confidence, and positive indicators included in report

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Jest configured for TypeScript and Next.js
- Tests in `lib/__tests__/`
- Focus on trust engine logic and utility functions
- Run with `npm test`

## Project Structure

### Key Files
- `lib/trust-engine.ts` - Core scoring logic (pure functions)
- `types/trust.ts` - Domain model types
- `app/api/verify/route.ts` - Main verification endpoint
- `app/api/webhook/route.ts` - Stripe webhook handler
- `components/TrustResults.tsx` - Results display with progressive disclosure

### Scripts
- `scripts/add-credits.ts` - Dev utility to add credits to users
- Excluded from TypeScript compilation (see `tsconfig.json`)

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public Supabase key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Admin operations (webhooks)
- `TWITTER_API_KEY` - twitterapi.io API key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe server key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Stripe webhook signing secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - App URL for redirects

### Local Development
- Use `.env.local` (gitignored)
- Copy from `.env.example` for reference
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker)
- Local Stripe webhooks: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook`

## UI/UX Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
- Score first (immediate answer)
- Breakdown second (understand why)
- Positive indicators third (build confidence)
- Risk flags last (what to watch for)

### State Persistence
- URL params (`?q=username`) for shareable links
- SessionStorage for instant restoration on refresh
- Both used together in `app/page.tsx`

## Common Pitfalls

### Avoid
- Using `any` or `unknown` types
- Mutating data structures (use `readonly`)
- Forgetting `await` on async Supabase clients
- Exposing service role key
- Processing webhooks without signature verification
- Charging credits before successful verification

### Remember
- Credit deduction happens AFTER successful verification
- Webhooks need admin client (no user session)
- API routes need `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- Comments explain why, not what

## Git Workflow

- Never commit `.env.local` (contains secrets)
- Always commit `.env.example` (placeholder values)
- Run `npm run build` before committing
- Ensure tests pass: `npm test`
